This week, we focused on three phenomena:

1. Possessives:
There are two paradigms for possessives in Purepecha. In the first, an independent pronoun that agrees with Person and Number of the possessor and precedes a noun. The second paradigm is for kinship relations and appears as a suffix on the noun that agrees with Person. We added several examples of each of these in the testsuite file.

Here is an example of the first paradigm:
jucheeti mintsita tsipe-sï-p-ti
1SG.GEN heart be.happy-AOR-PAST-3.IND
My heart was happy

I also provide an example of the second paradigm:
ima-eri primu-mpa juuata-rhu ireka-sï-p-ti
DEM.SG-GEN cousin-3.POSS mount-LOC reside-AOR-PAST-3.IND
His cousin lived on the mount

Here is the relevant change to the choices file:
section=adnom-poss
  poss-pron1_type=non-affix
  poss-pron1_agr=non-agree
  poss-pron1_mod-spec=spec
  poss-pron1_order=head-final
    poss-pron1_instance1_name=juchi
    poss-pron1_instance1_orth=juchi
      poss-pron1_instance1_feat1_name=number
      poss-pron1_instance1_feat1_value=sg
      poss-pron1_instance1_feat2_name=person
      poss-pron1_instance1_feat2_value=1st
    poss-pron1_instance2_name=jempa
    poss-pron1_instance2_orth=jempa
      poss-pron1_instance2_feat1_name=number
      poss-pron1_instance2_feat1_value=pl
      poss-pron1_instance2_feat2_name=person
      poss-pron1_instance2_feat2_value=3rd
  poss-pron1_possessum-mark=no

So far we have only implemented a change to reflect the 1st person and 3rd person SG possessive pronouns of the non-kinship independent pronouns. We note that our toolbox has considerable orthographical and dialectal disparities with other resources that we collect. Notably, the ‘jempa’ pronoun (3SG.gen) in our toolbox is variously “iri, interi, imeri” in Chamoreau. However, ‘jempa’ may be an older dialect, as it seems the toolbox data was mostly created from older corpora. 

2. Adverbial clausal modifiers
We add support for a particular set of adverbial clausal modifiers, such as “jimpoka” and “mientraske”. These adverbial clausal modifiers go either before or after the matrix clause. The modifier is a free subordinate morpheme. 

We also added 6 examples of ACM to the test suite 3 grammatical, 3 ungrammatical. The ungrammatical examples ensure the subjunctive marker ‘-ka’s absence is noticed such as the one in the grammatical example below:

ni-nt'a-s-p-ti=kxï jimpoka=kxï t'ire-ni ja-p-k'a
go-ITER-AOR-PAST-3.IND=S3PL SUB=3PL eat-INF exist-PAST-SBJNC
They went because they were eating
And that the correct order of the ACM is tested:

nira-sï-ka jimpoka=ni uanta-ka p'urhe
go-AOR-1/2IND SUB=1SG.SBJ speak-1/2IND P'urhepecha
I went because I spoke P'urhe

(not below):
nira-sï-ka uanta-ka p'urhe jimpoka=ni
go-AOR-1/2IND speak-1/2IND P'urhepecha SUB=1SG.SBJ
I went because I spoke P'urhe

The relevant choices file change was to create one clausal modifier strategy (cms1) in which the clausal modifier freely is allowed before or after the matrix clause, and is modeled as a free subordinator morpheme. We require further evidence to preclude attachment to either VP or an S.
section=clausalmods
  cms1_position=either
  cms1_modifier-attach=either
  cms1_subordinator=free
  cms1_subposition=before
  cms1_subordinator-type=head
    cms1_freemorph1_orth=jimpoka
    cms1_freemorph1_pred=_because_subord_rel


3. Embedded clausal
The subordinator ‘iski’ (with several allomorphs / alternative presentations) is an independent complementizer that connects a matrix clause to an embedded clause, which usually doesn’t coordinate with the matrix (according to Chamoreau). The embedded clause always carries a subjunctive mood, which presents as a suffix (-k’a/ka) on the verb of the embedded clause. 
We added several test items for the suite for this phenomenon:

ji ari-a-ka eski=rini t'u jurhaku-chi-∅-∅-ka
1SG say-FUT-1/2IND SUBORD=1SG.OBJ 2SG leave-APP.1/2-PERF-NP-SBJNC
Yo le diré que tu me lo dejaste

Another example is:
ji ueka-pirin-ka exki=ksï ixu ja-pirin-ka
1SG want-COND-1/2IND SUBORD=3PL here exist-COND-SUBJ

I would want that they be here
We are still researching the interplay between mood / irrealis / conditionality in these constructions and have not opted to shorten the verbal sequences considerably. However, we may plan to shorten these test items in the future.

To provide ungrammatical examples, we can, however, simply swap in another mood morpheme in place of the obligatory “-ka / SBJNC” morpheme:
ji ari-a-ka eski=rini t'u jurhaku-chi-∅-∅-ki
1SG say-FUT-1/2IND SUBORD=1SG.OBJ 2SG leave-APP.1/2-PERF-NP-INTER
intended : Yo le diré que tu me lo dejaste


To support these constructions, I added a verbal lexical class that supported the comps1 strategy (iski):


verb756_name=verb756
  verb756_valence=trans,comps1
    verb756_stem1_orth=ueka
    verb756_stem1_pred=_want_v_rel
    verb756_stem2_orth=ari
    verb756_stem2_pred=say_v_rel


Further work will be required to search for examples in which ditransitives are present in embedded clauses, and verify that that will not require additional verb classes.
We added the actual strategy in the following block:
section=clausal-comp
  comps1_clause-pos-same=on
  comps1_ques=prop
  comps1_comp-pos-before=on
  comps1_comp=oblig
    comps1_stem1_orth=exki
    comps1_stem2_orth=exka
    comps1_stem3_orth=eski
    comps1_stem4_orth=eska
    comps1_stem5_orth=iski
    comps1_stem6_orth=iska
  comps1_cformvalue=finite
    comps1_feat1_name=mood
    comps1_feat1_value=subj

I did not identify any irregularities of the automatically generated choices file after my changes.
