# Typed Feature Structures for modeling P'urepecha [tsz]

## Contribution Notes

We should work on our own feature branchs.

The contents of `tsz/` should not be edited directly for now. Edit the choices file at the root level, download the tar file from the Grammar Customization page, unpack and overwrite the `tsz/` directory.

Test suite skeletons go in `tsdb/` also at the root level.

## Files and Directories

`choices_orig` - original choices file from Google Drive
`choices_orig_fixed`: minimal version of the original choices file needed to get it to compile/build
`choices`: actual, working choices file. Make changes here, upload to Grammar Matrix page, download tar, unpack and overwrite `tsz/`
