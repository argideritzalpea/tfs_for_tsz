# Typed Feature Structures for modeling P'urepecha [tsz]

## Contributions

We should work on our own feature branchs.

The contents of `tsz/` should not be edited directly for now. Edit the choices file at the root level, download the tar file from the Grammar Customization page, unpack and overwrite the `tsz/` directory.

Test suite skeletons go in `tsdb/` also at the root level.
